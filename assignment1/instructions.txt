Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly! - done
docker build .

2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable. - done
docker run <image id>

3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers. - done 
docker run --detach --name thanh-nodeapp -p 3000:3000 <image ID>
docker run -it <image ID> 

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images. - done 
docker stop <container ID>, docker rm <container ID>
docker rmi <image ID>

5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.
docker build -t thanh-nodeapp . ; docker build -t thanh-pythonapp .

6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -rm <image ID>
